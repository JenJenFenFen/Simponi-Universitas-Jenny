# Simponi-Universitas-Jenny
This is my first project and i'm gonna list it in my portofolio.

I'm still new at this, but i want to keep learning and improve myself as a full-stack developer so one day i can start actually working on bigger project going solo or with a team.

I know that i need a lot more learning to do, whence i made this project. Any inputs or critics are welcomed.

The insipiration comes from my university's web app that helps students to check course schedule, course credit, input homework/assignment, and others.

i made it using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Jquery for front-end and Node.js, MariaDB or MySql for back-end.
