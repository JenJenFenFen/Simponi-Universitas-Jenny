# Simponi-Universitas-Jenny
This is my second project just for my portofolio

I'm newbie, i wanna be a full-stack web development and i realized that i have to learn more and more so that i can make 
a another project by myself and with my team later

My friend gave me a task like this so that i can do it by myself first

Simponi comes from my college, which is a web-program that help student like check course schedule, check course credits,
check score, input your task/homework, etc

i made it use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 for front-end and Jquery, Node.js, MariaDB for back-end
