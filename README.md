# Simponi-Universitas-Jenny
This is my second project just for my portofolio

I'm newbie, i wanna be a full-stack web development and i realized that i have to learn more and more so that i can make 
other projects myself or with my team later

My friend gave me a task like this so i can do it by myself first

The inspiration for Simponi comes from my college, which is a web-program that helps students like check course schedule, 
check course credits, check score, input task/homework, etc

i made it using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 for front-end and Jquery, Node.js, MariaDB for back-end
